# Online Shop Simulation

## To Add
- Remove some hardcoded values for expenses, stock levels, processing times, etc.

- Add configuration file support (JSON/Properties) for easy adjustments. Also allow command-line to change stock values, expenses, processing times, etc.

- Customer demand/intelligence

    - Budget constraints: Customers have budgets that influence their purchasing decisions. Likeness of high budget is likely exponential.

    - Product preferences
        - Is new or popular
        - discounted items
        - product relations
        - Seasonal trends

### Hardcoded Values

#### Hardcoded Relationships

- Numbers of products

    * Increasing this value automatically increases the stores base *budget?* because of how product prices are generated. **Not realistic.**

    **SOLUTION:**

    - Decouple product count from store budget. Introduce a fixed budget or a budget based on realistic factors (e.g., market size, customer base).
    - Introduce *manefacure store* that supplies the products to the online shop. Manefacture store can have contracts with suppliers, different customs, import costs, etc.
    - Implement a more sophisticated pricing model that considers factors like demand, competition, and market trends rather than just random multipliers.


#### Main.java
- **56**: Number of products to generate
    - Code: `List<Product> products = generateProducts(10);`
    - Value: `10`

- **63**: Order generation interval (seconds)
    - Code: `final int ORDER_GENERATION_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 5;`

- **9**: Thread pool size
    - Code: `private final ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);`

    ```

**Hardcoded Product Versions (with multipliers):**

## Changes from Version 7d63653

### Core Simulation Features Implemented

**TimeSimulator.java**
- Refactored to support configurable speed multipliers (1x, 4x, 8x, 32x)
- Added thread-safe time tracking with `AtomicBoolean` for proper concurrent access
- Implemented month-end detection for triggering monthly reports
- Added proper interrupt handling and shutdown mechanism
- Synchronized `getCurrentSimTime()` method for thread safety

**OrderProcessor.java**
- Implemented multi-threaded order processing with fixed thread pool (10 threads)
- Added `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe active order tracking
- Business hours validation: processes orders immediately during hours, queues outside
- Simulated processing time (500-2000ms per order)
- Stock reduction for processed orders
- Proper error handling for insufficient stock scenarios

**BusinessHours.java**
- Implemented `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for queuing orders outside business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
- `processQueuedOrders()` automatically processes queued orders when business opens
- Queue size tracking via `getQueueSize()` method
- Thread-safe order queueing mechanism

**MonthlyReport.java**
- Complete monthly financial reporting system
- Tracks: total orders, revenue, average order value, product sales metrics
- Generates formatted reports with:
  - Revenue summary (total orders, revenue, average order value)
  - Top 5 best-selling products with quantities and revenue
  - Top 5 least-selling products for inventory analysis
  - Fixed monthly expenses (salaries: $50k, rent: $10k, utilities: $2k, other: $5k)
  - Net profit calculation
- Automatic reset for month-to-month tracking
- Getter methods for programmatic access to metrics

**Main.java**
- Complete multi-threaded simulation with 4 concurrent threads:
  - Time simulator thread (advances simulated time)
  - Order generation thread (creates random customer orders at intervals)
  - Month-end checker thread (monitors for month transitions)
  - Main UI thread (handles user commands)
- Interactive command system:
  - Speed control: `realtime`, `4x`, `8x`, `32x`
  - Reporting: `report` (generates current month report)
  - Monitoring: `queue` (shows queued orders), `time` (displays current sim time)
  - Control: `quit` (graceful shutdown)
- Order generation respects product stock levels
- Automatic month-end report generation with counter reset
- Proper thread lifecycle management and cleanup

### Technical Improvements

- **Concurrency**: Proper use of thread-safe collections (`ConcurrentHashMap`, `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`, `AtomicBoolean`)
- **Threading**: 4 independent threads for simulation, order processing, month-end checks, and user input
- **Thread Pool**: 10-thread executor for parallel order processing
- **Interrupt Handling**: Proper handling of `InterruptedException` with thread interruption flag
- **Synchronization**: Synchronized access to shared simulated time resource
- **Resource Management**: Try-with-resources for Scanner, proper executor shutdown

### Simulation Behavior

- Orders generated every 5 seconds (scaled by speed multiplier)
- Orders placed outside business hours (before 9 AM or after 5 PM) are queued
- Queued orders process automatically when business opens
- Each order takes 500-2000ms to process (simulated)
- Stock reduced for each processed item
- Monthly reports auto-generate at month-end with comprehensive metrics
